1,5,"Hey! you know that Chance scouted out the location of the canyon when he was haveing her plane connections delayed and rerouted.
I loved the way L. Howard kept the character of Chance true to form from one story to the next.
Also if John is old enough to have a girlfriend he is old enough to get caught up in some machinations that needs Zane and Chance to rescue him and set him on the path of his two uncles'- besides Zane needs to produce another daughter and Chance one to put them into a hilarious competition [aided and abetted by their wives]
there are still enough up close stories to be told with Mary and Wolf still in the background -- and lets go back in time to Michael's and Josh's stories.
I, along with so many others, agree that this has been the best family series ever written - with all of the ladies well matched with the Mackenzie men - this is a family that can't stand still - these are classics -
With Sunny willing to put her life on the line for Chance, she does a great job of breaking down his reserve and teaching him to love.  Love only comes from giving.
I do love a woman who is willing to take care of her own self-preservation [grin] and dragging a man into realizing her worth.
L. Howard has spoiled us with her Mackenzie Men -- Don't stop now!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- DEFINITELY A KEEPER FOR ANY LIBRARY!",1,hey know chance scouted location canyon haveing plane connection delayed rerouted loved way l howard kept character chance true form one story next also john old enough girlfriend old enough get caught machination need zane chance rescue set path two uncle besides zane need produce another daughter chance one put hilarious competition aided abetted wife still enough close story told mary wolf still background let go back time michael josh story along many others agree best family series ever written lady well matched mackenzie men family stand still classic sunny willing put life line chance great job breaking reserve teaching love love come giving love woman willing take care selfpreservation grin dragging man realizing worth l howard spoiled u mackenzie men stop highly recommended definitely keeper library,1.0,127,Positive
77,5,"I have always loved Melissa & Doug because of their outstanding quality and educational value. When shopping for my kids I seek out the brand because its one I know I can trust.

This year is Jaxs first Christmas so its an extra special one for us. Of course Im going to go to a name I trust! At this age of almost one, he doesnt show much preference for toys. He basically likes anything and everything because he wants to explore this great big world. This is that rare time that I can get him what I want because hes not going to tell me otherwise!

The Melissa & Doug sound puzzles are the perfect gift for little ones. They help their growth and development with motor skills, problem solving and general thinking. Oh yeah, and they are super fun! My older kids have always liked puzzles and Jax is no different! Even though this is for 2+, he immediately started trying to put it together. He doesnt quite have the logic and reasoning to get the fit right but he sure had fun trying and big sister Paige helped him! As with all their products, the quality is good and durable. Lots of puzzles are flimsy and don't last long but these are thick wooden pieces with little red tabs for easy removal.

When you lift up or put down the piece, it makes the animal sound. I love that I can also teach Jax what sounds animals make while we do this together.

The Melissa & Doug Sound Puzzles are the perfect gift for little ones. They will think of it as a toy but as moms we know, they are learning!",1,always loved melissa doug outstanding quality educational value shopping kid seek brand one know trust year jaxs first christmas extra special one u course im going go name trust age almost one doesnt show much preference toy basically like anything everything want explore great big world rare time get want he going tell otherwise melissa doug sound puzzle perfect gift little one help growth development motor skill problem solving general thinking oh yeah super fun older kid always liked puzzle jax different even though immediately started trying put together doesnt quite logic reasoning get fit right sure fun trying big sister paige helped product quality good durable lot puzzle flimsy last long thick wooden piece little red tab easy removal lift put piece make animal sound love also teach jax sound animal make together melissa doug sound puzzle perfect gift little one think toy mom know learning,1.0,147,Positive
647,4,"This is a long 2 part story. It appears to be made for Canadian TV. No sex, nudity, or bad language. Like American movies, the bad guys are black, except in this one they speak French Canadian. The main bad guys hang out in Switzerland and boast a mish-mash of indistinguishable international accents, including one female (Belladonna Lithia) whose haircut makes me think she was once part of the Swedish Bikini team of the 1980's.

Ryan Carnes plays Chris Mooore, who lives with people he thinks are his parents. Like Luke Skywalker his past is kept secret and then one day he comes home, finds his legal guardians killed by the bad guys and vows revenge. Like Spiderman, he also likes the redhead next door. And there is a corporate meeting which reminded me of the one in Kill Bill.

Chris Moore has lost his memory and doesn't know he is the Phantom, although he does like to jump around the roofs of buildings. Once he is arrested, his DNA goes out on the Interpol network and he is discovered by the Good Guys and the Bad Guys, the Singh. Eventually Chris assumes the role of the Phantom and uses his new high tech bullet proof suit. It turns out his dad died from cancer (must have been those purple dyed asbestos fibers in the old suit). The bad guys have  a weapon called ""Flicker"" or Flickr for you Yahoos or Flicka for you cowboys. This device uses digital TV to turn people into Manchurian Candidates, who will keep the war machine going and the arms dealers rich.

The movie doesn't have long drawn out action scenes. It is long on dialogue and building characters. If this is the first in a series. i.e. an introduction of characters, they did a good job. However, if this is it, you might wait until you have 3 hours to kill on a movie that is more carrot on a stick than action.",1,long part story appears made canadian tv sex nudity bad language like american movie bad guy black except one speak french canadian main bad guy hang switzerland boast mishmash indistinguishable international accent including one female belladonna lithia whose haircut make think part swedish bikini team ryan carnes play chris mooore life people think parent like luke skywalker past kept secret one day come home find legal guardian killed bad guy vow revenge like spiderman also like redhead next door corporate meeting reminded one kill bill chris moore lost memory know phantom although like jump around roof building arrested dna go interpol network discovered good guy bad guy singh eventually chris assumes role phantom us new high tech bullet proof suit turn dad died cancer must purple dyed asbestos fiber old suit bad guy weapon called flicker flickr yahoo flicka cowboy device us digital tv turn people manchurian candidate keep war machine going arm dealer rich movie long drawn action scene long dialogue building character first series ie introduction character good job however might wait hour kill movie carrot stick action,-0.99,180,Negative
